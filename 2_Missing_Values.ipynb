        "\n",
        "Imagine for example that the data comes from a survey, and the data are entered manually into an online form. The data entry could easily forget to complete a field in the form, and therefore, that value for that form would be missing.\n",
        "\n",
        "The person being asked may not want to disclose the answer to one of the questions, for example, their income. That would be then a missing value for that person.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sometimes, a certain feature can't be calculated for a specific individual. For example, in the variable 'total debt as percentage of total income' if the person has no income, then the total percentage of 0 does not exist. Therefore it will be a missing value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together with understanding the source of missing data, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which missing fields are introduced in a dataset. Depending on the mechanism, we may choose to process the missing values differently. In addition, by knowing the source of missing data, we may choose to take action to control that source, and decrease the number of missing data looking forward during data collection."

In other words, the probability an observation being missing depends only on available information (other variables in the dataset). For example, if men are more likely to disclose their weight than women, weight is MAR.
