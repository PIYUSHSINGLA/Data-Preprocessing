Alternatively, replacing by 999 or -999 are common practice. We need to anticipate that these arbitrary values are not a common occurrence in the variable.

        "The missing indicator technique involves adding a binary variable to indicate whether the value is missing for a certain observation. This variable takes the value 1 if the observation is missing, or 0 otherwise. One thing to notice is that we still need to replace the missing values in the original variable, which we tend to do with mean or median imputation. By using these 2 techniques together, if the missing value has predictive power, it will be captured by the missing indicator, and if it doesn’t it will be masked by the mean / median imputation. These 2 techniques in combination tend to work well with linear models. But, adding a missing indicator expands the feature space and, as multiple variables tend to have missing values for the same observations, many of these newly created binary variables could be identical or highly correlated."

This method may result in better accuracy, unless a missing value is expected to have a very high variance.

One can experiment with different algorithms and check which gives the best accuracy instead of sticking to a single algorithm."
